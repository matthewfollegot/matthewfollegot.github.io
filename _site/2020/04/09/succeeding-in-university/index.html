<br><br><h1 class="text-white">Welcome!</h1><br>
<p style="font-weight: lighter;" class="mb-4 f3 text-white">
  I'm a third-year Engineering Student at the University of Waterloo. I've previously worked at Splunk and PagerDuty as a Software Engineering Intern and I'm always looking for unique opportunities to apply my skills and learn some more.
</p>
<p style="font-weight: lighter;" class="mb-4 f3 text-white">
I'm particularly interested in building highly reliable and scalable systems, however I'd love to hear from you if you believe I'd be a good fit for additional opportunities.
</p><br><br>
<!-- <p class="mb-4 f3 text-white">
  Being a deeply curious individual, I have many interests that are not work-related. The one I'm most passionate about is learning new languages. I'm currently learning Spanish and I aspire to be a polyglot by age 25. I really enjoy meditating and the benefits due to the benefits it provides. I was also really into yoga for a little while, but it's often difficult to incorporate it into my schedule when at school and doing it at home just doesn't feel the same to me.
  I'm a big sports fan, I've played soccer competitively all my life. I've been a long-time Arsenal and Raptors fan and that will never change. I'm not big in visual arts, but I do love music and I'm really hoping to improve my guitar skills before I graduate.
