<br><br><h1 class="text-white">Welcome!</h1><br>
<p style="font-weight: lighter;" class="mb-4 f3 text-white">
  I'm a third-year Engineering Student at the University of Waterloo. I've previously worked at Splunk and PagerDuty as a Software Engineering Intern and I'm always looking for unique opportunities to apply my skills and learn some more.
</p>
<p style="font-weight: lighter;" class="mb-4 f3 text-white">
I'm particularly interested in building highly reliable and scalable systems, however I'd love to hear from you if you believe I'd be a good fit for additional opportunities.

<!-- <p class="mb-4 f3 text-white">
  Being a deeply curious individual, I have many interests that are not work-related. The one I'm most passionate about is learning new languages. I'm currently learning Spanish and I aspire to be a polyglot by age 25. I really enjoy meditating and the benefits due to the benefits it provides. I was also really into yoga for a little while, but it's often difficult to incorporate it into my schedule when at school and doing it at home just doesn't feel the same to me.
  I'm a big sports fan, I've played soccer competitively all my life. I've been a long-time Arsenal and Raptors fan and that will never change. I'm not big in visual arts, but I do love music and I'm really hoping to improve my guitar skills before I graduate.

<p>I was thinking of splitting this up into multiple blog posts, but I feel like they’re all related.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code></code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="start-with-you">Start with YOU</h2>

<p>Look after yourself. Stop studying for hours on end. Stop killing yourself.
Far too often, I see people neglecting <em>themselves</em> due to school, work, etcetera. I’ve fallen victim to this many times myself, but I’m getting better at it. A healthy routine will always win. You need to make time for the things that you enjoy. I do a lot of experiments with measuring my own productivity and incorporating things into your day-to-day which you enjoy and take your mind off work or school seem to make all the difference. Anyway, my point here is that making time for yourself and the things you enjoy will pay dividends to your overall productivity and overall mood.</p>

<p>The most important thing for me, however, when it comes to productivity is sleep. Everyone is different, but only 5% of people can function at peak performance consistently with less than ~7 hours of sleep. For the other 95% of us, sleep is of the utmost importance. I personally feel best when I’m sleeping around 8 hours. I also find that the later I sleep after midnight, the lower my quality of sleep and the more tired I feel the next day. The optimal time for me to sleep is around 12 am to 8 am.</p>

Eventually, that co-op will come to an end and you <em>will</em> get the marks you strived for. The feeling of accomplishment from landing the co-op and the 3.9 GPA will be temporary, but the strain on your well-being and relationships will be far more permanent.</strong></h4>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code></code></pre></div></div>

<p>At Waterloo, especially being in co-op, we students compete so fiercly with each other. We can see our ranking in respect to the rest of our class at the end of each semester. Co-op is on a whole other level, though. Everyone’s competing for the best jobs and it’s like a positive feedback loop. One person grinds harder than everyone else to get that job they’re really after. Then, the next person raises the bar, and so on and so forth. On top of that, you see your friends getting internships at top tech companies, which adds to that pressure. Balancing 10+ interviews during a 4 week time period while having midterms is pretty brutal.</p>

<p>As hard as it is to swallow, these internships don’t matter all that much. Sure, shoot for the best, but don’t get down on yourself if you don’t succeed. Regardless of what happens, you’ll have a job and you’ll be learning. By the time you’re going into your fifth or sixth co-op you’ll be competitive enough to land the job you’ve always wanted, so don’t kill yourself in the first few years. My point is, everything will be fine, whether you land your dream job or not.</p>

<p>I think it’s more important to try different types of jobs early on and figure out what you <strong>don’t</strong> like. It’s usually easier than figuring out what you <em>do</em> like. The former can also help you discover the latter. I stress doing this early on during your internships because once you get a couple internships under your belt in the same industry, it’s difficult to switch because you’ll be far less competitive in that new industry, you’ll be working a less challenging job (more entry-level), and will probably be paid less.</p>

<p><em>Once you find out what you do enjoy, you will quickly make up the time you spent in other jobs, because you’ll finally be engaged and curious.</em></p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code></code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Back to my main point of this section</strong>, co-op doesn’t matter as much as you think does in the grand scheme of things. Neither do your marks, unless you’re interested in continued education, but even then there are far more important things. Everyone is different, but for me and probably most people, my well-being and my relationships with my loved-ones take precedence over co-op and my grades. I still try very hard in the aforementioned, however I seldom allow them to affect my well-being and relationships with my loved-ones.</p>

<p>Figure out what is most important to you and prioritize those over all else. Eventually, that co-op will come to an end and you <em>will</em> get the marks you strived for. The feeling of accomplishment from landing the co-op and the 3.9 GPA will be temporary, but the strain on your well-being and relationships will be far more permanent.</p>

<p>This is also part of the North American culture, however, so we are more susceptible to it than our European counterparts, for example. We could take some lessons from them here.</p>

<h2 id="do-whats-difficult">Do what’s difficult</h2>

<p>This applies to life in general, but I first noticed this at the end of my first semester of University. In high school I was a straight-A student with little effort. I could usually read over some notes and do a few questoins and do well that way.</p>

<p>This didn’t work in University. Jump to the next section to find out more about what why it didn’t work, I’d like to keep this section more general.</p>

<p>Doing what’s difficult is applicable for pretty much anything that involves improving in some shape or form, might it be at your job, at a hobby, or even trying to achieve your dream body.</p>

<p>Difficult things are difficult for a reason. Easy things are easy for a reason. Easy things don’t help you improve, because they’re usually not demanding of all your focus and effort. Difficult things can be extremely frustrating. Take for instance a naïve example of working out. If you go to the gym and walk on the treadmill for an hour, you won’t see much results. If you, instead, work your a** off for an hour doing High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) you <strong>will</strong> see results.</p>

<p>The same goes for learning a new skill, the more cognitively-demanding, the more applicable. I’ll use programming as an example. If you just copy others’ projects you’re barely even challenging yourself. If you attempt to implement algorithms yourself and attempt to understand what’s going on under the hood of an HTTP request, you’re going to become a much better developer. By doing the difficult thing, you’re <em>forcing</em> yourself to <strong>grow</strong>. You’re devoting all of your mental capacity to the task at hand, not 50% of it.</p>

<p><strong>Nobody ever became the best [insert noun here] because they did exactly what everyone else was doing. I can guarantee you that the best writer, the best sculptor, the best painter challenged themself more than everyone else. They failed, over and over again, and learnt from their failures.</strong></p>

<h2 id="university-isnt-actually-that-hard">University isn’t actually that hard</h2>

<p><strong>Deliberate practice</strong>, remember the term.</p>

<h4 id="this-section-serves-as-an-extension-to-the-previous-one-but-ill-focus-on-university-here-more-broadly-studying">This section serves as an extension to the previous one, but I’ll focus on University here, more broadly, <em>studying</em>.</h4>

<p>If you just blindly copy solutions or recite your lecture notes… well, you can guess what’ll happen. You did not challenge yourself enough, so when the time comes to be challenged on the exam, you’re gonna flunk it. What I coined as ‘doing what’s difficult’ in the last section, I’ll call deliberate practice in this.</p>

<p>It’s what I didn’t do in my first semester of University. I still did decently well, with a 79.5% average, but I put in so many hours to achieve it. The next semester, I finished with an 87.5% average, despite getting a 67% in a course. That semester, I finished one course with 100% and another with a 97%. The courses were Finance and Electrical Circuits, respectively, which are very different in nature.</p>

<p>What I did differently this semester was NOT refer to my lecture notes constantly. I would put them away (for the most part) and work at the assigned pracitce problems. It goes without saying that I did attend lectures so that I was able to do this, more on that later. I worked on the difficult problems, constantly challening myself, <em>deliberately practicing</em> so to be able to solve the next difficult problem. Deliberate pracitce means working at something for the intention of improving at it, to become better than you were yesterday.</p>

<p>In second year, I averaged an 85.5% and I’m studying less than I did in first year and I try to apply this principle of deliberate pracitce to other areas of my life, that was the whole point of the previous section. Although I’m preaching this, I still fall victim to doing the easy thing, but when I catch myself doing so, I immediately stop.</p>

<p>So I mentioned I attend my lectures, or most of them anyway. I believe that everyone learns differently and there are definitely some courses that I don’t attend because I don’t see the value. However, I still attend until I figure that out. Attending lectures helps you stay on track and space out your practice, it makes learning easier than trying to cram everything at once.</p>

<p>Regardless of what you decide, it’s important to develop a good study regimen that enables you to practice deliberately. If you fall far behind in a course, it makes it more difficult to deliberatly practice as you’re learning and practicing at the same time. They should not be coupled in that way. I like to be just on-track with my courses so that when the time comes to studying for an exam, I can deliberately practice. It would work better in more frequent increments, but it’s not always ideal.</p>

<p>Anyways, that’s the trick, it’s really nothing special, but I’m sure it makes sense :)</p>
