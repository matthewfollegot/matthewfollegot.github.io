<br><br><h1 class="text-white">Welcome!</h1><br>
<p style="font-weight: lighter;" class="mb-4 f3 text-white">
  I'm a third-year Engineering Student at the University of Waterloo. I've previously worked at Splunk and PagerDuty as a Software Engineering Intern and I'm always looking for unique opportunities to apply my skills and learn some more.
</p>
<p style="font-weight: lighter;" class="mb-4 f3 text-white">
I'm particularly interested in building highly reliable and scalable systems, however I'd love to hear from you if you believe I'd be a good fit for additional opportunities.
</p><br><br>
<!-- <p class="mb-4 f3 text-white">
  Being a deeply curious individual, I have many interests that are not work-related. The one I'm most passionate about is learning new languages. I'm currently learning Spanish and I aspire to be a polyglot by age 25. I really enjoy meditating and the benefits due to the benefits it provides. I was also really into yoga for a little while, but it's often difficult to incorporate it into my schedule when at school and doing it at home just doesn't feel the same to me.
  I'm a big sports fan, I've played soccer competitively all my life. I've been a long-time Arsenal and Raptors fan and that will never change. I'm not big in visual arts, but I do love music and I'm really hoping to improve my guitar skills before I graduate.

    <p>This is a meditation on 20.5 years of life. A lot has changed over the last 3 years since I started University. I’d like to touch on a few different topics, perhaps those that I feel are most important.</p>

<h2 id="start-with-you">Start with YOU</h2>
<p>Look after yourself. Stop studying for hours on end. Stop killing yourself.
Far too often, I see people neglecting <em>themselves</em> due to school, work, etcetera. I’ve fallen victim to this many times myself, but I’m getting better at it. A healthy routine will always win. You need to make time for the things that you enjoy. I do a lot of experiments with measuring my own productivity and incorporating things into your day-to-day which you enjoy and take your mind off work or school seem to make all the difference. Anyway, my point here is that making time for yourself and the things you enjoy will pay dividends to your overall productivity and overall mood.</p>

<p>The most important thing for me, however, when it comes to productivity is sleep. Everyone is different, but only 5% of people can function at peak performance consistently with less than ~7 hours of sleep. For the other 95% of us, sleep is of the utmost importance. I personally feel best when I’m sleeping around 8 hours. I also find that the later I sleep after midnight, the lower my quality of sleep and the more tired I feel the next day. The optimal time for me to sleep is around 12 am to 8 am.</p>

<h2 id="what-really-matters">What really matters</h2>

<p>At Waterloo, especially being in co-op, we compete so fiercly with each other. We can see our ranking in respect to the rest of our class at the end of each semester. Co-op is on a whole other level, though. Everyone’s competing for the best jobs and it’s like a positive feedback loop. One person grinds harder than everyone else to get that job they’re really after. Then, the next person raises the bar, and so on and so forth. On top of that, you see your friends getting internships at top tech companies, which adds to that pressure. Balancing 10+ interviews during a 4 week time period while having midterms is pretty brutal.</p>

<p>As hard as it is to swallow, these internships don’t matter all that much. Sure, shoot for the best, but don’t get down on yourself if you don’t succeed. Regardless of what happens, you’ll have a job and you’ll be learning. By the time you’re going into your fifth or sixth co-op you’ll be competitive enough to land the job you’ve always wanted, so don’t kill yourself in the first few years. I’m kind of getting on a tangent</p>
